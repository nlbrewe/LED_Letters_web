  <h1>LetterC Animation</h1>
  <p>Animation refers to how colors and pixels appear to move on the display. The pixels don't actually move, but by turning
    them on and off and changing the colors of the pixels gives them appearance of movement. The following options are available:
  </p>
  <p> <b>None</b> - No animation - You pick either a solid color or rainbow in the Color menu, and the pixels are set to the color(s) you choose.
    There is no motion or color change associated with the pixels.</p>
  <p> <b>Theater</b> - Pixels are arranged in groups of 3 contiguous pixels, and only one of the 3 is lit at a time. The lit
    pixel moves one step at a time,making the entire display appear to rotate. The speed of movement is controlled by the "speed
    of animation" setting.</p>
  <p> <b>Pulsate</b> - The pixels can be set to either a solid or rainbow color. The intensity of the pixels goes from 0-255 and
    back to 0 making the display appear to pulsate. The speed of pulsation is controlled by the "speed of animation" setting.</p>
  <p> <b>Scanner and Rotate</b> - These two modes are similar.  A group of pixels moves together over the display. The Scanner display starts at the beginning of the
    neopixel strip and goes to the other end of the strip, then returns. The Rotate display starts at the beginning and moves to the end,
    then starts again at the beginning. The <b>Length</b> slider controls how big the group of pixels that moves is. The length slider only
    appears when Rotate or Scanner mode is selected.
