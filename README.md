# LED_Letters_web
LED_Letters are decorations for my grandkids rooms.  They consist of large (26" high) MDF letters with Adafruit Neopixels arranged around the outside.  I have built two versions of the letters.  The first version used a generic IR remote control and arduino mini(s) to control the display.  I used the Adafruit neopixel library on the Arduino mini, but found I could not read the IR remote and run the Neopixels at the same time because the IR remote caused timing problems with the Neopixels.  I got around this by using two Arduino mini boards, one that was dedicated to getting the "stop" signal from the remote and halting the neopixel library.

The latest "web" version uses a Raspberry Pi zero W with the Adafruit Raspberry Pi neopixel library (python3) to control the display.  The RPI0W connects to a local wireless lan and runs an Apache2 web server.  The index.html file allows the user to select display options and submit the options to a Python3 program runneopixel.py.  The neopixel python library must be run as superuser, so runneopixel.py uses sudo to start another copy of Python3 in superuser mode to run setcolor.py.  setcolor.py uses the python neopixel library to light the pixels and run animation to make the pixels move.

I'm still working on the best way to let the user update the wireless LAN credentials, and right now they are hard coded.  I plan to add a switch to let the user bring up an ad-hoc web page to accept updated credentials.
