  <h1>LetterC Troubleshooting</h1>
  <p>The LetterC uses a Raspberry Pi 0 W to host a web page that controls the display. The raspberry pi 0 w is a tiny single-board microcomputer
    that runs the linux operating system. The rpi0w has an on-board wifi chip that allows it to connect to a wireless LAN using your network name
    and network password.</p>

  <p>The display is a string of 99 neopixels or WS2812 Integrated Light Sources. Each neopixel contains a red, green and blue LED integrated
    alongside a driver chip into a tiny surface-mount package controlled through a single wire. You
    can learn more about neopixels at:

      <p> <b>Connection Problems</b></p>
      <p>Connection problems can keep the LetterC display from connecting to your wireless LAN. This could happen because the wifi signal reaching the letterC
        is too weak, or because the credentials built into the LetterC no longer match your LAN credentials. To eliminate signal strength as an issue, move
        the LetterC close to your wireless router. </p>
